    <h3> Who am I?</h3>
    
    <p> Currently, I am a <strong>stressed</strong> junior at The New School studying Journalism &amp; Design with a minor in Fashion Communitions. I'm suprisingly making my way through finals with out dying (yet.)
      I am in my early twenties, trying to navigate my way through life and finding my place in the world. Right now I live in Mount Vernon, NY with my Jamaican grandmother, and that is another story for another time. I was born in White Plains, 
      NY but after the tragedy of 9/11 my family and I moved to Tampa, FL. I have two older brothers, Justin and Jonathan, 
      and a little yorkie named Julio. My favorite color is pink, (specifically millennial pink) 
      I love to sleep, eat, shop, and read (in that order.) </p>

    <h3>What I'm About</h3>
    
    <p> As of now my ultimate goal in life is to run an online publication for young women of color.
      I want to be able to create a platform that young girls and women can go and to be able 
      to relate to one another. Coming from a background of predominately white peers, I have always found myself to be uncomfortable in my own skin and unable to understand what it means to be Black, espically being Black in the south. I've found it has been easier for me to have uncomfortable conversations about race, sex, and gender to understand where other people are coming from as well as how I can articulate my feelings.</P>
