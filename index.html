    <h3><u>Who am I?</u></h3>
    
    <p> Currently, I am a junior at The New School studying Journalism & Design with a minor in Fashion Communitions.
      I am 20 years old, (21 in July #Cancer) I live in Mount Vernon, NY. I was born in White Plains, 
      NY but after 9/11 my family and I moved to Tampa, FL. I have two older brothers, Justin and Jonathan, 
      and a little yorkie named Julio. My favorite color is pink, (specifically millennial pink) 
      I love to sleep, eat, shop, and read (in that order.) </p>
    
    <h3><u>What am I about?</u></h3>
    
    <p> As of now my ultimate goal in life is to run an online publication for young women of color.
      I want to be able to create a platform that these young girls and women can go and to be able 
      to relate to one another and to learn and ask the questions that they woudn't normally ask 
      their white friends.</P>
