    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p> I am currently a Junior at The New School studying Journalism & Design with a minor in Fashion Communitions.
      I am 20 years old. I live in Mount Vernon, NY. I was born in White Plains, NY but after 9/11 my family and I
      moved to Tampa, FL. I have two older brothers, Justin and Jonathan, and a little yorkie named Julio. My favorite
      color is pink, (specifically millennial pink) I love to sleep, shop, and read (in that order.) </p>
